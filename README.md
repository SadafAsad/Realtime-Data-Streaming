# Realtime User Data Streaming
This project aims to simulate a live data streaming pipeline for collecting, transforming, and storing data. It leverages Python, Airflow, PostgreSQL, Kafka, Spark, and Cassandra to create an end-to-end solution. Docker is employed to containerize everything, ensuring consistency and simplified deployment.
